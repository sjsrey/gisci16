# Tutorial Proposal: Spatial Data Analysis with  PySAL

**Sergio J. Rey**  School of Geographical Sciences and Urban Planning, Arizona State University

**Dani Arribas-Bel** Department of Geography and Planning, University of Liverpool



## Description

A unique feature of this tutorial is the use of Python based software tools for
spatial data analysis. Python is an object oriented scripting language that is
gaining rapid adoption in the computational sciences.  To facilitate this
adoption within the GIScience community the presenters and colleagues have developed PySAL:
Python Library for Spatial Analysis. Since its initial release in July 2010,
PySAL has been downloaded over 100,000 times and has become a featured package
in the leading Python distributions for scientific computing.


This two-part tutorial will first provide participants with a gentle
introduction to Python, and an introduction to version 1.11 of PySAL with a
focus on  exploratory spatial data analysis.  The second part of the tutorial
shifts the focus to spatial econometrics, regionalization and geodemographic
applications of PySAL.  Part I is thus designed for participants with no prior
Python experience, while the second part assumes knowledge of materials covered
in Part I.

## Instructors

Part 1: Introduction to PySAL for spatial data analysis - **Sergio J. Rey**

Part 2: PySAL for spatial econometrics, regionalization, and geodemographics - **Dani Arribas-Bel**

**Sergio J. Rey** is Professor of Geographical Sciences and core faculty member
of the GeoDa Center of Geospatial Analysis and Computation at Arizona State
University. Prior to joining ASU he was Chair and Professor of Geography at San
Diego State University where he was also the founding director of the Regional
Analysis Laboratory (REGAL) and co-director of the Center for Earth Systems
Analysis Research (CESAR).  He is a Fellow of the Spatial Econometrics
Association.

Rey is project director for PySAL and the creator of the open source package
STARS: Space-Time Analysis of Regional Systems. His research interests are in
the area of geocomputation, exploratory space-time data analysis, spatial
econometrics and urban/regional modeling with substantive applications to
problems in regional economics, criminology, epidemiology, spatial demography
and urban dynamics, among others. Rey served as editor of the *International
Regional Science Review* from 1999-2014, and is currently the editor of
*Geographical Analysis*. He  is an editorial board member of *Computers,
Environment and Urban systems,  International Regional Science Review,
Professional Geographer, Region et Devloppement, and Spatial Demography.*

**Dani Arribas-Bel** is Lecturer in Geographic Data Science and member of
the Geographic Data Science Lab at the University of Liverpool (UK). Previously,
he held positions as Lecturer in Human Geography at the University of Birmingham,
postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Spatial Economics at the VU University
(Amsterdam), and postdoctoral researcher at the GeoDa Center for Geospatial 
Analysis and Computation at Arizona State University. 

Trained as an economist, Dani is interested in the spatial structure of cities as well
as in the quantitative and computational methods required to leverage the power of the 
large amount of urban data increasingly becoming available. He is also part of the team
of core developers of PySAL, the open-source library written in Python for spatial
analysis. Dani is also the book editor of *Environment and Planning B -
Planning and Design*.

## Audience

GIScientists, researchers and students interested
in learning Python and using PySAL for computational scripting in
spatial analysis as well as for spatial econometrics, regionalization and geocomputation.

## Prerequisites

This tutorial is geared towards individuals who have a basic
understanding of exploratory spatial data analysis and spatial
regression.

## Required Materials

-   The tutorial will consist of computationally-based instruction. This
    will include basic scientific scripting (PySAL).

-   Participants are encouraged to bring their own laptops. We will
    cover installation of all required software in the morning session.


-   Software Requirements

    -   Software will be made available on site.
    -   Software will also be available for download before traveling to the meeting


-   Sample data sets will be provided with the packages.

## Expected Number of Participants

Based on previous experience, the tutorial should be capped at 25.
